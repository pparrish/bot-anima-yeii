for now each of this have a container but every time must hace to chamge someting i must call to thad container this is a problem because o need to inport all of this every time i must have do something with a value
the solution is have a unique source of true for all and that is the character sheed
There is a aproach with the domain driven development because the sheed is a idded value

the idea is for the sheed can be locked but for now not be locked

the sheed must expose all necesary methods to change and obtain data from the sheed

the idea is nobody else from sheed knows nothing of how the values is changed in the sheed, for now i dont use another abstraccion for the method to store the values in the sheed

the sheed must be
sheed
  (sheed| id| json file| object ) => sheed
  id => Unique reference to get all sheed
  plain => Gets a plain object of the sheed
  set(id, value) => set a value for something in the sheed if the id does not exist the sheed cant change
  get(id, value) => get a value in the sheed if the id cant be found the sheed throw a error
  rules => is a getter /setter observer for all values changed in the sheed
  
mow the sheed internal is a storage of all data in it
the base of the sistems is maibe paths
the paths now access to a resource of sheed
